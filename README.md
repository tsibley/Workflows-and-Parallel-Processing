This is a short talk I gave on GNU make, Makefiles, and parallel processing to
the Mullins Lab Computational Biology Group.

The easiest place to start is the [PDF](CBG-2014-05-21.pdf).  There are copious
presenter notes below each slide that capture much, though not all, of the talk
itself.

Everything else in this repository is supporting materials, though not all of
it is used in the talk.  My plans were more extensive than I had time for!

Note that all sequence data in `seqs_na.fa` was randomly fabricated.
